"""
    Who is still awake during the darkness
    Dark mood with the cloak and mask
    The darkness of night is not the darkest
    But we cannot find the baseline of the greedy

    Humble street is under the feet
    I stand on the skylines of the city alone
    Don't suspect me of the evil or kind
    I am just a mammal desiring to fly

    The river between evil and kindness
    Is not about an uncrossable opposite aspect
    But the defense for innocence
    Of everyone
    Nothing can get away from the challenge

    Is there a challenge or not
    Is there a quenching or not
    Which rescues the world just like the plot of hero movie
    Is there a belief or not
    Is there a oath or not
    Which calls the appearance of dawn
